## Cost Clarification

### Your Question: "What is ₹90,940 if they had ₹500/month?"

**Answer:** The pricing I mentioned was **₹599/month** (not ₹500).

**Breakdown of ₹90,940 (5-year Total Cost of Ownership):**

```
Year 0:
- Development Cost: ₹30,000 (one-time)
- Subscription: ₹7,188 (₹599/month × 12 months)
- Subtotal: ₹37,188

Year 1:
- Subscription: ₹7,188
- Maintenance: ₹5,000
- Subtotal: ₹12,188

Year 2:
- Subscription: ₹7,188
- Maintenance: ₹5,000
- Subtotal: ₹12,188

Year 3:
- Subscription: ₹7,188
- Maintenance: ₹5,000
- Subtotal: ₹12,188

Year 4:
- Subscription: ₹7,188
- Maintenance: ₹5,000
- Subtotal: ₹12,188

TOTAL: ₹37,188 + (₹12,188 × 4) = ₹90,940
```

**Simplified:**
```
5-year subscription: ₹7,188 × 5 = ₹35,940
Development: ₹30,000
Maintenance: ₹5,000 × 5 = ₹25,000
TOTAL: ₹90,940
```

### If It Was ₹500/month:

```
Annual: ₹500 × 12 = ₹6,000
5-year: ₹6,000 × 5 = ₹30,000
+ Development: ₹30,000
+ Maintenance: ₹25,000
TOTAL: ₹85,000
```
